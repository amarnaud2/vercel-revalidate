Trigger ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) from WordPress to Vercel on post update. Perfect for decoupled Next.js + WordPress setups.

== Description ==

This lightweight plugin sends a revalidation request to your Vercel-hosted Next.js app every time a WordPress post is updated or published.

Features:
* Automatic revalidation on post update
* Admin settings page to configure endpoint and secret
* Secure HMAC signature verification by default
* Manual revalidation form for any slug
* Log history with export and cleanup
* Compatible with Next.js Pages Router & App Router
* Multilingual support: English and French

Ideal if you're using `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` in your Next.js app.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu.
3. Go to **Settings > Vercel Revalidate** and configure your secret and endpoint URL.
4. Ensure your Next.js app has an API route like `/api/revalidate` that validates the secret and triggers ISR.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to use Vercel? =
Yes. This plugin is designed to work with ISR via a custom API endpoint deployed on Vercel.

= Can I revalidate a specific slug manually? =
Yes. The admin settings page includes a form to revalidate any given slug manually.

= How do I secure the connection? =
Use a strong secret key and check it inside your Next.js API route before triggering revalidation. This key is never send in clear. It's encrypted.

= Is it compatible with all themes? =
Yes. The plugin works in the background and doesn’t interfere with any frontend theme.

= Can I clear the logs? =
Yes, the Logs page allows you to view and delete all revalidation history.
